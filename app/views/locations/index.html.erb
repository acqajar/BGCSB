                <h2>What We Do</h2>
                <p>Established in 1989, the Boys and Girls Clubs of the South Bay have been serving the communities of Los Angelesâ€™ South Bay.  We serve over 2,500 kids and 400 parents each year. Club membership is available for boys and girls between the ages of 6 - 18 for a nominal $20.00 annual fee providing youth with access to, and use of, all facilities, programs and services the Clubs have to offer. Membership fees can be waived in special circumstances.</p>

                <p>Our activities are focused in the communities of Harbor City, Harbor Gateway-Gardena and Harbor Gateway-Torrance.  The boys and girls from these communities face various challenges and barriers that put them at risk for gang involvement, crime, sexual activity and alcohol, tobacco and other drug use.  The socio-economic conditions, combined with a lack of affordable and available after-school activities, both on and off school campuses, leave them with little or no opportunities for positive activities or support to enable them to achieve their full potential.  Linguistic and cultural barriers add additional challenges.</p>
